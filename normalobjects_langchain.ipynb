      "FINAL RESPONSE:\n",
      "The Demogorgon seems puzzled by the question, indicating that understanding its behavior may require thinking beyond our three-dimensional perspectives. \n",
      "\n",
      "The D&D party is also unsure, suggesting that further investigation might be necessary to uncover theories about its eating habits. It might be worth exploring the Demogorgon's motivations, environmental factors, or even its hunger cycles to gain more insight. Would you like to investigate any specific aspect further?\n",

      "============================================================\n",

      "FINAL RESPONSE:\n",
      "There isn't a clear schedule for portal openings in Hawkins. Historical records indicate that portals have opened on various dates, influenced by energy surges and specific locations. Patterns are difficult to discern, making it unpredictable.\n",

      "============================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "FINAL RESPONSE:\n",
      "The historical records in Hawkins don't provide a direct answer to why psychic powers vary among individuals, but it is noted that strange events are quite common in the area. Additionally, the party suggests that further investigation is needed to understand this phenomenon better. \n",
      "\n",
      "It might be worth exploring individual backgrounds, traumas, or even genetic factors that could influence the development of psychic abilities in different people. Would you like me to look into any specific cases or related events in Hawkins that could shed more light on this?\n",

      "Electricity behaves strangely near creatures in Hawkins due to the connection to the Upside Down's electromagnetic fields. These fields can cause electrical anomalies, resulting in unusual behavior of electrical devices and phenomena in the vicinity of these creatures.\n",
